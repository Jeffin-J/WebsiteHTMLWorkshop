### Project Setup Steps

1. **Fork the Repository**
   Before cloning, you need to fork the repository to your own GitHub account.

   Go to the repository: https://github.com/tudev/WebsiteHTMLWorkshop. (Same fork button on the top right of this page)

   Click the Fork button in the top-right corner of the page.

   This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tudev/WebsiteHTMLWorkshop.git
   cd WebsiteHTMLWorkshop
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   Run the following command to install required npm packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Update Your Info**
   Open the `resumeData.json` file and update it with your details:

   ```json
   {
     "basics": {
       "name": "Your Name",
       "role": "Your Role",
       "location": "Your Location",
       "email": "your.email@example.com",
       "phone": "+1 (XXX) XXX-XXXX"
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Run the Project Locally**
   Use the following command to start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see your website.

6. **Build for Production**
   To generate the optimized files for deployment, run:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   Your site will be ready in the `dist/` folder.

7. **Deploy to Netlify**
   We will cover this step during the workshop

## üìú Scripts

Below are the key npm scripts you can use:

- `npm run start`: Starts a local development server with live reloading.
- `npm run build`: Builds the website for production.
- `npm run clean`: Cleans the dist/ folder.
- `npm run imagemin`: Optimizes images for faster loading.
- `npm run scss`: Compiles and minifies SCSS files.

## üí° Tips

- Customize your site by editing `index.html` or styling with `css/style.scss`.
- For advanced changes, update other files in the repository as needed.

## Troubleshooting Tips

### Windows

- If you get permissions errors, make sure you're running PowerShell as Administrator
- If Chocolatey commands fail, try refreshing your PowerShell session

### macOS

- If Homebrew commands fail, try running `brew doctor`
- Make sure your system PATH includes Homebrew's bin directory

### Linux

- If apt commands fail, try running `sudo apt update` first
- For VS Code, you might need to restart your system after installation
